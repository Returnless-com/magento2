## About Returnless ##
With Returnless, you can easily automize and optimize your return proces by setting up a custom return form for your e-commerce webshop. We can help you to reduce your returns costs and -percentage, while making your consumers happy with a unique return experience.

Using the Returnless Connector for Magento 2, you can connect your return form with your Magento 2 backend, so that we can load the order information from your store. A customer will enter the order increment ID + customer emailaddress so that we can load all relevent order items related to the order. To use the Magento Connector, you will need a [Pro subscription](https://www.returnless.com/tarieven) for Returnless.
  

## Supported features of the Returnless Connector ##
- Load order info from your return form by Magento Increment ID.
- Validate order by customer email address.
- Load order items related to order.
- Load product information (e.g. product images) related to order items.
